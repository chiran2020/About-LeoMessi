# FEWD-ClassOne-Project
Front-End project for class one.

This project is about one of my favorite soccer player Leo Messi. Although I donâ€™t have a page about him yet, that is the plan for the future. At the movement, I have used a few features to accomplish this project. 

Some of the features I have used are, Flex-Box to align contents, Media-Queries for the mobile version, and JavaScript for the navbar. 

My goal is to add more content as I learn new knowledge and skills. Finally, I also want to add more small JS to this project.
